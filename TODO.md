## üî¥ Priority Bug Fixes & Issues
*Issues discovered during testing that need immediate attention*

### üîê Permission Management Issues
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Comprehensive permission prompting** 
  - Issue: Need to ensure ALL required permissions are properly requested and granted
  - Specific concern: "Do Not Disturb" access permission (ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY)
  - Current state: May not be guiding user through complete permission setup
  - Action needed: Review and improve permission request flow in MainActivity
  - User experience: Should walk user through each permission with clear explanations

### ‚ö° Service On/Off Toggle Issues  
- [ ] **HIGH: Service toggle state persistence**
  - Issue: Service toggle may not properly persist off state
  - Observed behavior: User turned service off, but after reopening app it was back on
  - Current state: Toggle functionality may be resetting or not saving properly
  - Action needed: Investigate SharedPreferences persistence and service lifecycle
  - User experience: Toggle should reliably stay in the state user set it to

### üìã Related Investigation Tasks
- [ ] Test permission flow from fresh install - verify all permissions requested
- [ ] Test toggle functionality - verify off state persists across app restarts
- [ ] Test service behavior when toggle is off - ensure service actually stops
- [ ] Review AndroidManifest.xml for complete permission declarations
- [ ] Check if we need additional permission request dialogs or settings redirects

### Final Testing
- [ ] Test complete flow: add contact ‚Üí receive call/SMS ‚Üí volume override
- [ ] Test after phone restart
- [ ] Test with phone in Do Not Disturb mode
- [ ] Test battery usage over a few days
